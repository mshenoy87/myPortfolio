                                    ðŸŒŸ Hi, Iâ€™m Megha Shenoy! ðŸŒŸ

                                    Iâ€™m a problem-solver, and lifelong learner with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Chicago (Class of 2024).
                                    <br />
                                    With experience as a Software Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services and Origami Risk,
                                    Iâ€™ve honed my skills in building robust software solutions and collaborating in agile team
                                     environments. Iâ€™m passionate about coding and have a versatile toolkit, including Python, 
                                     ReactJS, Flask, and Django.
                                    <br />
                                    Currently, Iâ€™m diving into web development by creating a dynamic menu app for Addis Cafe, the cafe I work at,
                                     that integrates the Square API into a web application for customers to find information about the cafe, browse a menu, and join a mailing list.
                                     When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy crafting fun projects like misinformation detection models and interactive games,
                                     fueling my creativity and curiosity.
                                    <br />
                                    Iâ€™m all about teamwork, adaptability, and finding joy in the creativity! ðŸ’»âœ¨
